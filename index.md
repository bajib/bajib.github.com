<!-- I was a computer engineering student at [Institute of Engineering, Central Campus Pulchowk, Lalitpur, Nepal][1].

### Research Interests

   * Machine Learning, Data analysis and Anomaly Detection
   * [Streaming Algorithms][2] and [Mining][3]
   * Algorithms and [Optimisation][4]
   * [Distributed Algorithms][5]

I'm currently working on distrbuted streaming algorithms for log mining. I work on clustering of log messages in real time, and anomaly detection based on statistical techniques for [SIEM solutions][3].

Previously, I have worked on financial data representation and mining using [XBRL][6] for annual financial statements collected by [Office of Company Registrar, Nepal][7]. -->
