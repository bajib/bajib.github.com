Core Course offered in the third year of Bachelor of Computer Engineering in Tribhuvan University.


#### Course Objectives:

The main objectives of this course are:

1.	To provide basic knowledge of Artificial Intelligence
2.	To familiarize students with different search techniques 
3.	To acquaint students with the fields related to AI and the applications of AI


####  Syllabus 

1.		Introduction to AI 							 	(4 hrs)

<!-- The questions will cover all the chapters of the syllabus. The evaluation scheme will be as indicated in the table below:

Chapters	Hours	Marks distribution*
1	8	14
2	8	14
3	10	18
4	10	18
5	9	16
Total	45	80
*There could be a minor deviation in Marks distribution -->

#### Laboratory Work:

Laboratory exercises should be conducted in either LISP or PROLOG.
Laboratory exercises must cover the fundamental search techniques, simple question answering, inference and reasoning.
